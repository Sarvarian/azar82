Genre: Action

Beats:

- Hero defining crisis.
- Story world: Enslavement from physical attack.
  - The Enclosure: Kind of fortress.
    - Pressure-cooker effect
  - The Chaos: Moving fast.
- Story world: Technology of the gun.
- The warrior's moral code: Courage and will to greatness.
  - Master of war: Fighter, destroyer, enforcer, and bringer of justice.
- Weakness-Need: Driven to excellence at the expense of everything else.
- Desire: Success, glory, and personal freedom.
  - Success.
  - Driven to be the best.
  - An Action story should have a specific end point where the
    audience knows the hero won, and it should result in the
    hero attaining some kind of personal freedom.
  - For the Action hero, the ongoing practical benefit of
    winning is freedom. It is fundamental to their very being.
- Visual Shape of the Action Plot: Linear
  - In Action, the hero’s desire line must force him into constant
    combat. The Action hero is always fighting to get the goal.
  - The Action hero moves at top speed with relentless energy to
    get a specific goal. This makes the Action story the most linear
    of all forms.
  - This straight line creates intense narrative drive, which is
    a great advantage in popular storytelling.
  - While Horror stories sell maximum pressure on the hero, the Action
    story is about speed.
- Collecting the Allies
  - Each ally brings a special skill. The idea is to create a group
    of all-stars, each the best in their area of expertise.
- Opposition: External Bondage
- Opponent: Hero’s Nemesis
  - The Action opponent is someone the hero must actually fight. Thus,
    the opponent is usually strong and dangerous.
  - The best Action opponent is also the hero’s nemesis, the most dangerous
    opponent for that particular character. Therefore, the opponent should be
    the second-best fighter and the character best able to attack the hero’s
    biggest internal flaw.
- Combine action and thriller
  - Action and Thriller are often combined in Hollywood films because
    both genres put the hero in extreme danger.
  - The key question in the Thriller concerns who the real opponent is.
    Is the suspect guilty or innocent?
  - The key question in the Action story concerns how to defeat the opponent.
  - Action stories do not focus on uncovering, or detecting, the opponent.
    They focus on fighting him.
- The four-point opposition and
  hierarchy of opponents.
  - Plot comes from a change of action and from surprise, known as "reveal".
  - The average action story has a lot of back-and-forth conflict.
  - Web of opponents.
  - Provide the hero with one main and at least two secondary opponents.
  - Hide one or two opponents and/or hide the way they’re connected to
    each other. In other words, connect the opponents in a hidden hierarchy.
  - Each opponent should attack the hero in a different way.
  - Opponents should attack the hero in succession at top speed.
- Training
  - Action is the most training-oriented of all story forms.
- Tactic
  - Tactics are the ability to win the battle.
  - Tactics are thinking about the present.
  - Tactics are the right response in the
    moment, known as acting efficiently.
